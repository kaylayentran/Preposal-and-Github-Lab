#An idea I have for my final project is to create a girl's dress up game, where you can put different outfits on a "Barbie" mannequin.
#Another idea I have if the Barbie game is too difficult is a simple hangman game.
#However, if I find that hangman is too easy, I would want to create a code using Turtle to replicate an image.



#I would like to collaborate with Jesse Tang.



#What would you deem too easy as a final project?
